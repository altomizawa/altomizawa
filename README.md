# Hello, my name is Al Tomizawa
### I'm a senior Art Director/Designer who can code.
(I'm also owner of a CrossFit box, my wife's personal chef and my daughter's uber driver )

My past:
  - Worked at advertising agencies in [NY](https://www.bartleboglehegarty.com/new-york) and [LA](https://www.tbwachiatdayla.com/) creating campaigns for brands like Playstation, JBL, Whiskas, etc.
  - Opened one of the first CrossFit Boxes in Brazil

What I'm up to now:
  - I finished Triple Ten's Web Developer course and trying to improve my coding skills because it's fun and challenging

Fun Facts:
  - I'm very good a Photoshop. [Here's an image](https://www.instagram.com/p/CZdjcets-qA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) of my daughter's dream of a sausage in a bathtub (she was only 6 at the time)
  - [I'm the first CrossFitter](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXqbBkjBOeo/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) in Brazil (since 2008)
